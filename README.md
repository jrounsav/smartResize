# smartResize

This object is intended to provide a means of "intelligently" resizing menu items in response to the size of a user's screen,
with the goal of keeping all items on a single line.
It does not account for ADA compliance and is intended exclusively for visual css generation and application.

ToDo: 
- remove jQuery requirements
- Build style markup
- apply markup to head
- Apply pre-application of css in response to values in localStorage
